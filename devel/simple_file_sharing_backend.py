# This is a simple example script demonstrating a backend service
# that will listen for requests on remote computers to upload files
# that are stored locally.
#
# You can store some content locally via
# uri = kcl.store_text_local('random-text-00001')
# Now this file is stored locally but not in the cloud
# On a remote computer you can send a request to upload
# the file. See the file_share_remote_test.py example
# and paste in the desired url and the project ID
# for this backend.

# uri is obtained from kcl.store_*_local(fname) on this computer
